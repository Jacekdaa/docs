### Configuration

**On TriggerMesh:**

1. Request beta access to TriggerMesh cloud at [https://triggermesh.com](https://triggermesh.com)
2. Download your TriggerMesh configuration file by clicking on the `download` button in the upper right corner
3. Save the file as `$HOME/.tm/config.json` and you are ready to use the `tm` CLI

**On your own knative cluster:**

Assuming you have access to the Kubernetes API and have a working `kubectl` setup, `tm` should work out of the box.
